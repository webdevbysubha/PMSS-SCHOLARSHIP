# PMSS-SCHOLARSHIP
## Introduction-
The Prime Minister's Scholarship Scheme (PMSS) is a welfare initiative launched by the Government of India to support the educational aspirations of the dependents of ex-servicemen, ex-coast guard personnel, and police personnel who were martyred in action. The scheme is aimed at empowering students by providing financial assistance for higher education in recognized institutions across various professional courses such as engineering, medicine, dental, veterinary, MBA, MCA, and other technical degrees. It reflects the nation's gratitude for the selfless service and sacrifices of its armed forces and police personnel, while fostering academic excellence and professional growth among their children and wards.
